*    because the material is not yet visible in the target location).
*    When the movement into the stock is posted, this is accepted.
* 2) Valuated stock:
*    a) Movements within a single plant (MA05, MA06 =
*       movement types 313-316) are ignored.
*    b) The moving of material out of a plant (303/304)
*       is counted and valuated in the emitting plant and
*       the target plant. The moving in
*       (305/306) is ignored, because
*       the valuated stock appears in the target at the
*       very moment of leaving the emitter.
*    c) Material documents without valuation string are ignored.

* Unfortunately the output list of this report consists
* of several ALVs, one started at the end-event of the other.
* This abstrucse programming style was chosen to create a list
* layout similar to the one in release 3.1. Now this causes a severe
* problem: When selecting a line, we do not know which ALV (and there-
* for which line in table IMSEG) has been selected. We can only use
* the value of the selected field to access the data-table.
* In case of ambiguities, a popup has to be transmitted where the
* user has to reselect the document he wants to see. This is
* difficult to understand, if you do not know the problems of
* programming ABAP.
