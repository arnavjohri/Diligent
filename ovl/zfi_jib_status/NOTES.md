# ZFI_JIB_STATUS — Management Dashboard, "JIB Status" card (design notes, 03/11/26)

**Project:** OVL (ONGC Videsh) · dev OCQ/500, sample document from PRD · object name
provisional. **Nothing is built yet** — this file holds what was established in chat on
03/11/26 so the design survives the session.

**Purpose:** per joint venture, has the month's JIB (Joint Interest Billing received from the
operator — OVL is the non-operating partner) been posted, and when. Requirement workbook:
`docs/Management_Dashboard_-_JIB_Status_-_Final.xlsx` (sheet *JIB Status*).

| Column (workbook) | Example | Source (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| JV Code | AA2002 | T8JV-VNAME |
| Project Name | ACG | T8JVT-VTEXT |
| Business Unit | MENA & CIS BU | fixed attribute of the JV — Z mapping table (see open questions) |
| Status | Uploaded / Pending | JM document with venture in the period exists / does not |
| Date | 21.04.2026 | MAX( BKPF-CPUDT ) of those documents |

Filters: Project, Business Unit ("freezed input" = fixed per JV, BU dropdown wanted),
Period (month / quarter / year).

## What a JIB posting looks like in PRD (BKPF row supplied 03/11/26)

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BUKRS / BELNR / GJAHR | OVL / 1026000459 / 2026 | document key |
| BLART | JM | document type — the only machine-stamped marker |
| BLDAT = BUDAT | 30.04.2026 | the JIB *for* April 2026 |
| MONAT | 1 | FY variant April–March: April = period 1, GJAHR 2026 = FY 2026-27 |
| CPUDT / CPUTM | 21.05.2026 17:45:13 | entered on 21 May → the dashboard "Date" |
| TCODE | FBVB | posted from a *parked* document (FBV0 path), not by BAPI |
| XBLNR | AIOC JIB | free text, typed by the user |
| BKTXT | For April ,26 | free text, typed by the user |
| BSTAT / STBLG | blank | posted (not parked), not reversed |
| AWTYP / AWKEY | BKPFF / 1026000459OVL 2026 | manual FI document |
| WAERS / HWAER | USD / INR | |

BKPF carries no venture. BSEG-VNAME on the line items does (join on BUKRS, BELNR, GJAHR).

## How a JIB document is recognised — and why BLART is the key

- Nothing in BKPF/BSEG says "JIB". OVL's upload program `ZJV_BAPI_BALUPLOAD1` (repo:
  `ovl/zjv_bapi_balupload1/`) and its sister `ZJV_BAPI_BALUPLOAD1_MON` stamp **only the
  document type**, read from GS01 set `ZJVNONOPJIB_DOCTYP_MON` (`G_SET_GET_ALL_VALUES`,
  table BKPF, field BLART). `header_txt` and `ref_doc_no` are copied from the upload file
  (`ist_gl-htext`, `ist_gl-refdoc`) — so XBLNR / BKTXT are whatever the user typed and
  cannot be filter keys.
- The PRD sample is `TCODE FBVB` — a parked document that was posted. `BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST`
  never produces FBVB, so at least some JIBs are parked and posted by hand. The document type
  is still the common marker, as long as the hand-posted ones also use JM (the sample does).
- Read the document type from the same set (`SETLEAF`, set `ZJVNONOPJIB_DOCTYP_MON`) or a
  Z customizing table rather than hardcoding `'JM'`; the set is what the upload uses.

### Checks on PRD before anything is built (display only)
1. **Done 03/11/26 (GS03 screenshot):** set `ZJVNONOPJIB_DOCTYP_MON`, "Set for NonOP JIB
   upload-DocType-Monthly", table BKPF, field BLART, one line: `JM`. So every monthly JIB
   posted by the upload carries JM. Still open: is there a provision set (`_MON` has a
   JIB-provision mode, memory ID `ZJIB_PROV`)? If provisions post under JM too they would
   show as "Uploaded".
2. `SE16N BKPF`: BUKRS `OVL`, BLART `JM`, GJAHR `2026` → every row should be a JIB
   (XBLNR / BKTXT / USNAM / TCODE tell). Any non-JIB row means JM is not exclusive.
3. `SE16N BKPF`: BUKRS `OVL`, XBLNR `*JIB*`, BLART ≠ `JM` → any row means JIBs also go
   through another document type and BLART alone misses them.
4. `SE16N T003T`: BLART `JM`, SPRAS `EN` → the configured description.
5. One JIB that was parked on an earlier day than it was posted: FB03 → header *Entered on*
   vs *Environment → Document changes*. Settles whether CPUDT is the park date or the post
   date after FBV0 (the sample has AEDAT blank, so it cannot tell).

## Selection logic (proposed, not yet written as an object)

```
BKPF   bukrs = OVL, blart = JM (from set / Z table), bstat = ' ', stblg = ' ',
       budat between P_DateFrom and P_DateTo
join   BSEG on bukrs, belnr, gjahr, where vname <> ' '
group  by vname  ->  max( cpudt ) as LastEntryDate, count(*) as Documents
driver T8JV (bukrs, vname) LEFT OUTER JOIN the aggregate -> no row = Pending
texts  T8JVT-VTEXT (field names confirmed by active SAPMZOVL_JV_CC_PAI)
BU     Z mapping table (vname -> BU, project name) — or CASE on the venture prefix
       (AA Azerbaijan / SD Sudan -> MENA & CIS; MM Myanmar -> AP) as ZDPR_Q_DASH_FILTER does
       for assets. Recommend the table: "freezed input", maintainable by SM30.
```

- Period attribution by **BUDAT** (the JIB *for* April has BUDAT 30.04.2026); the "Date"
  shown is **CPUDT** (entered 21.05.2026). The workbook sample "21.04.2026" for AA2002 is
  then the March JIB, entered in April — confirm the semantics with the requester.
- A document can carry several ventures (one upload file, many JVs) — the per-venture
  grouping handles it.
- Venture from BSEG, not ACDOCA ledger 0L: on this landscape 0L venture is incomplete
  (`ovl/zfi_acdoca_jva_align`), and a JIB line has the venture explicitly on BSEG.
- Shape, if it joins the existing dashboard: classic `define view` with parameters named
  `P_DateFrom` / `P_DateTo` (the Overview Page hands filter values to cards by parameter
  NAME — see `ovl/zpra_dpr/dashboard/README.md`), `@OData.publish: true` → OData V2 service,
  same pattern as `ovl/zpra_dpr/zdpr_rap/ZDPR_Q_DASH_FILTER.ddls.asddls`.
  MEMORY.md §4.1 applies (no `year()`/`month()`, no `@Semantics.*` in view entities,
  parameters typed with data elements, `CASE` not in `GROUP BY` → helper view).

## Open questions (03/11/26)
1. `JM` is the set value (confirmed 03/11/26). Exclusive to JIBs, and used by every JIB
   including hand-parked ones (checks 2–3 above)? Still open.
2. Which document type do JIB **provisions** use?
3. Quarter / year period: "Uploaded" when every month is posted, or when any is?
4. Business Unit mapping: Z table (recommended) or hardcoded CASE on the venture prefix?
5. "Date" = CPUDT (entered) — confirmed by Arnav's wording "last creation date"; the
   requester's sample dates should be checked against that reading.
6. Company code OVL only, or every company code with ventures?

## Shipping
New CDS objects by ADT paste (no SE80 baseline, so no `original/`). Nothing built yet.
